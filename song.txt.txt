When I get home
You better not be there, we're placing bets you won't
Shed your modesty
And the only thing to leave behind is your own skin
On the floor
Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an "I love you" (ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote, that's never heard
Don't you (sh)
When you get home
You barely recognize the pictures they put in a frame
'Cause you shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Take what you have
And leave your skin on the floor
Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an "I love you" (ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote, that's never heard
